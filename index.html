            <p>Fullmetal Alchemist is an anime that follows two brothers, Edward

                to fix their mutilated bodies.

            <p>Hunter X Hunter is a deceptive story that opens as a child's action adventure story
                but develops into a dissection of the meaning of friendship and an exploration in loss
                and suffering. It maintains its action adventure skeleton throughout all of this however.

            <p>Samurai Champloo is an adventure story that follows three characters Mugen, Jin and Fuu.
                Fuu is on a journey to find a man with a specific scar who killed her father? (I think), Mugen 
                is simply a wild card figure who turns out to be more than he appears as Jin is a Samurai with no allegiances 
                trying to do something (I don't remember him much).
